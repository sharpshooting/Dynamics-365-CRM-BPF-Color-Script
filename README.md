# Custom Color Script for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (CRM) Business Process Control

In the Fall'16 release of Dynamics 365 (8.2), Microsoft disabled support for applying a theme color to the Business Process control. 
This script can be added to an organization and executed on every form load (on load web resource) to apply the custom colors defined to the various stages of the control's chevrons.

## Instructions

(TO-DO: need to expand this section)

## Compatibility

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| 8.2 RTM | Tested; mostly works (see to-do list) |
| 8.1 or earlier  | Not tested; should *not* work |

Dynamics 365 8.2 introduces a new version of the Business Process control with a different DOM structure from that of previous versions (8.1 and earlier), making this script incompatible with them.

## To-do List

* Implement abandoned stage colors on web client
* Implement gradients on web client
* Use colors from applied theme
* Calculate hover and selected colors with luminance values
